			<h2>Work Experience</h2>
			<h4>Marketing Assistant Intern</h4>
			<h5>Fontus Blue | May 2020 - Current</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>As an intern with Fontus Blue, I worked with the Sales and Marketing Team while also using my technological background. My main tasks are to find new leads by doing research and analyzing databases to find water quality departments that would be a good client to us . Once I find these leads, I  reach out to them on LinkedIn, a cold call, or an email. On top of these tasks, I learned how to use HubSpot and Salesforce in full. In HubSpot, I developed emails with personal graphic design pictures to interest leads as well as sort leads into lists for outreach. Within Salesforce, I tracked every move I made as well as any progress with leads or accounts. I also extracted data from databases daily and kept it in Excel where it was organized.</li>

I improved my skills in Autodesk Fusion 360 and CorelDRAW by making prototypes for projects in the curriculum.
